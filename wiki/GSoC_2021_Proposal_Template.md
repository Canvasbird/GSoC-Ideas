## GSoC 2021 Proposale Template

This template is for participant applying to Google Summer of Code. It is a very important step in the process. By working on this proposal you will have a clearer idea about the project and it will also give us a chance to get to know you. Please be realistic and honest while writing this proposal. 

You can also refer [Google's guide to Writing a Proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal)

It's good to have a well spaced timeline with doable goals for each week and buffers for each task. 

This is a sample template. You can add other sections which you think add value to your proposal
Please remember that you must submit your application to Google's GSoC portal. It is not possible to accept you if you do not do this.

***Tip : Finish writing your proposal early so that you can get it reviewed by your mentors and the community, before the deadline. They can give you valuable suggestions on your timeline and project details.***

## Basic Details

- Full Name
- Email ID and Github Username
- Location & Time Zone (This will have no impact on your selection.)
- Github Username
- Share links, if any, of your previous work on open source projects
- Anything else you would like us to know.

## Abstract/Summary

- What problem does your project solve and how does it impact Canvasbird?
- What technologies will you be using ?

## Project Details

- A very detailed description of the project idea.

- Use flowcharts, diagrams and mocks as much as possible

- Think about various tests that you will have to write

- If your project involves writing APIs, what will those APIs look like

- Discuss your assumptions

- Mention your deliverables

- Break down the bigger picture into smaller tasks and explain in detail each component of the pipeline. In planning your project, it is good to note where along the way you could formulate a pull request. These would be points where you can have a self-contained and well documented and tested piece of functionality. Doing this at several points during the summer helps to keep the branch merges reasonable and code reviews manageable. A big code dump at the end of the summer will likely be hard to review and merge before the project deadline.

- If you have found existing work that we can build on top of - mention those.

- If you plan to use a specific algorithm/layer/model/library/framework, mention them here.

- Include technologies you are planning to use and your familiarity with them.

**We can't stress enough that we want specific details! We love details! Think of this section as a specifications document that you would give to a team of software engineers and designers to build the feature.**

If you aren't sure about the details you are supposed to include in here, then ask for feedback from mentors. They will point out missing details, inconsistencies etc.

While we understand this is preliminary and will get refined over the course of the summer with help from the mentor, it will help you plan the project much better. Think of this section as what you would give to the executives of a company who cares only about when will it get done. Not how will it get done, but when will it get done!

## Timeline

- Break down the entire projects into chunks and tell us what will you work on each week.
As the summer goes on, you and your mentor will adjust your schedule, but it's good to have a plan at the beginning so you have an idea of where you're headed.
- If you will be off-the-grid for a few days, then mention those in the timeline.
GSoC has three evaluations, once after every 30 days. Highlight the work you plan to complete before each evaluation.
- How many hours will you spend each week on your project ?
- How will you report progress between evaluations ?
- Discuss your post GSoC plans. Will you continue contributing to Sugar Labs after GSOC ends ?
- You can refer to the [official guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/proposal-example-1) to get an idea. 

## OpenSource Contributions

- If you have contributed to Canvasbird or any other open source project, please provide the link of the pull requests with one-line description of the feature you added or the bug you fixed.
- If you have contributed by opening issues or conducting events, feel free to mention that as well.

## Time Commitment

How much time can you spend weekly on the project? Are you doing some other internship along with GSOC? What happens when your college reopens after the summer break?
