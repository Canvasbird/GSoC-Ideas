## GSoC 2021 Proposale Template

This template is for participant applying to Google Summer of Code. It is a very important step in the process. By working on this proposal you will have a clearer idea about the project and it will also give us a chance to get to know you. Please be realistic and honest while writing this proposal. 

You can also refer [Google's guide to Writing a Proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal)

It's good to have a well spaced timeline with doable goals for each week and buffers for each task. 

This is a sample template. You can add other sections which you think add value to your proposal
Please remember that you must submit your application to Google's GSoC portal. It is not possible to accept you if you do not do this.

***Tip : Finish writing your proposal early so that you can get it reviewed by your mentors and the community, before the deadline. They can give you valuable suggestions on your timeline and project details.***

## Basic Details

- Full Name
- Email ID and Github Username
- Location & Time Zone (This will have no impact on your selection.)
- Github Username
- Share links, if any, of your previous work on open source projects
- Anything else you would like us to know.

## Abstract/Summary

- What problem does your project solve and how does it impact Canvasbird?
- What technologies will you be using ?

## Project Details

Describe your project idea in as much detail as you can. Explain what APIs/algorithms/technologies you intend to use/study (if any). You can also include links to additional details like diagrams, mocks, flowcharts etc outlining your ideas acting as supplementary information for your proposal outside of this scope.
The strongest proposals will help us understand why these features are a good idea. How will the features you propose help the project or its users?

**We can't stress enough that we want specific details! We love details! Think of this section as a specifications document that you would give to a team of software engineers and designers to build the feature.**

If you aren't sure about the details you are supposed to include in here, then ask for feedback from mentors. They will point out missing details, inconsistencies etc.

While we understand this is preliminary and will get refined over the course of the summer with help from the mentor, it will help you plan the project much better. Think of this section as what you would give to the executives of a company who cares only about when will it get done. Not how will it get done, but when will it get done!

## Timeline

- Break down the entire projects into chunks and tell us what will you work on each week.
As the summer goes on, you and your mentor will adjust your schedule, but it's good to have a plan at the beginning so you have an idea of where you're headed.
- If you will be off-the-grid for a few days, then mention those in the timeline.
GSoC has three evaluations, once after every 30 days. Highlight the work you plan to complete before each evaluation.
- How many hours will you spend each week on your project ?
- How will you report progress between evaluations ?
- Discuss your post GSoC plans. Will you continue contributing to Sugar Labs after GSOC ends ?
- You can refer to the [official guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/proposal-example-1) to get an idea. 

## OpenSource Contributions

- If you have contributed to Canvasbird or any other open source project, please provide the link of the pull requests with one-line description of the feature you added or the bug you fixed.
- If you have contributed by opening issues or conducting events, feel free to mention that as well.

## Time Commitment

How much time can you spend weekly on the project? Are you doing some other internship along with GSOC? What happens when your college reopens after the summer break?

## Additional Information

## What to expect from your mentor (and what your mentor expects from you)

If you are selected to GSoC with Canvasbird, you can expect the following:
- We recognize that the goals may change during the project, and the mentors will accept modifications to the goals at any time. But they are also expecting to see the reasonable effort go into the initial project timeline. Any changes to your goals or plan are expected to be immediately communicated to your mentor.
- The scope of the project might change so as to fit in the duration of GSoC
- Your mentor will establish a weekly, synchronous check-in with you.
- In addition to that check-in, your mentor will discuss with you any specific status updates or any other regular communication they expect from you as well as which methods they prefer for documentation and collaboration (Google Docs, wiki, etc.).
- The project plan and timeline you set forth in your application will also form a significant part of your mid-term and final evaluations.

## What to expect from GSoC at Canvasbird

We want you to have a productive, engaging summer. To that end:
- We will schedule several events throughout the summer where you can interact with other GSoC students and the rest of the community.
- You will have the opportunity to present your work to this broader community.
